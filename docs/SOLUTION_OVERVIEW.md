# ChargeMe Solution Documentation

## Solution Architecture

### Overview
The ChargeMe solution is a comprehensive electric vehicle charging management system built with .NET 6 and Vue.js. It implements the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) for standardized communication with charging stations.

### Key Components

#### 1. Backend Services

**chargeme-app.Server** (Main API)
- **Purpose**: Primary API server for the charging application
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Transaction management
  - Payment processing
  - Real-time communication via SignalR
- **Controllers**: AuthController, TransactionController, ChargerController, etc.

**csms** (Charge Station Management System)
- **Purpose**: Management interface for charging stations
- **Features**:
  - Station configuration
  - Connector management
  - Real-time status monitoring
  - Transaction logging

**manager**
- **Purpose**: Administrative interface backend
- **Features**:
  - User management
  - Station administration
  - Dashboard analytics
  - Card management

#### 2. Frontend Applications

**chargeme-app.client** (Vue.js Application)
- **Technology**: Vue.js with modern UI framework
- **Purpose**: Main user interface for EV drivers
- **Features**:
  - User registration/login
  - Station locator
  - Payment processing
  - Transaction history

**chargeme-app.csms**
- **Purpose**: CSMS web interface
- **Features**:
  - Station management dashboard
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Configuration tools

#### 3. Core Libraries

**OCPP.Core**
- **Purpose**: Implementation of Open Charge Point Protocol
- **Components**:
  - OCPP.Core.Lib: Core protocol implementation
  - OCPP.Core.Database: Database entities
  - OCPP.Core.Server: OCPP server functionality
  - OCPP.Core.Management: Management components

### Database Architecture

The solution uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Entity Framework Core for data access. Key entities include:

- **TblUsers**: User accounts and authentication
- **TblStations**: Charging station information
- **TblChargers**: Individual charger units
- **TblTransactions**: Charging session records
- **TblPayments**: Payment processing records
- **TblConnectorStatuses**: Real-time connector status

### Security Features

1. **JWT Authentication**: All API endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Secure Payment Processing**: Integration with external payment gateways
4. **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest

### Payment Integration

The system supports multiple payment gateways:
- QR code generation for mobile payments
- Real-time payment status tracking
- Automatic transaction reconciliation
- Support for various payment methods

### Real-time Features

1. **SignalR Hubs**: Real-time communication for:
   - Charger status updates
   - Payment status notifications
   - User session management

2. **Memory Caching**: Fast access to frequently accessed data

### Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**: Follow the existing project structure
2. **Documentation**: Use XML comments for public APIs
3. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for business logic
4. **Error Handling**: Use proper exception handling and logging
5. **Security**: Always validate user input and implement proper authentication

### Deployment

The solution supports multiple deployment scenarios:
- Development environment with local database
- Production deployment with PostgreSQL
- Docker containerization support
- Azure/AWS cloud deployment ready

### API Documentation

All APIs follow RESTful conventions and include:
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JSON request/response formats
- Authentication headers
- Error handling with meaningful messages

### Monitoring and Logging

- Structured logging throughout the application
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Error tracking and alerting
- Transaction audit trails
